## Course Project:
Among the 3 HW problems, do an in-depth research on one topic.

* [HW2](https://github.com/PHBS-2017-ASP-Classroom/BSMmodel_Base): Black-Scholes-Merton (lognormal) vs Bachelier (normal) model: price, greeks and implied volatility
* [HW3](https://github.com/PHBS-2017-ASP-Classroom/SpreadBasketOptions_Base): Spread/Basket (multi-asset) option pricing
* [HW4](https://github.com/PHBS-2017-ASP-Classroom/SABRModel_Base): SABR model (Stochastic volatility)

You are very welcome to do the project on your own original idea and you will get additional credit for that. Otherwise, pick one from my suggestions which are basically understanding and implementing literatures. The github repository for the project should be consist of

* Core implementation (.py): python class and functions
  * Make sure to comment in detail.
  * Put them in a separate subfolder (e.g., option_models) Do not mix with testing/manual notebook files
* Documentation/Manual (.ipynb): one Jupyter notebook file briefly describing the method (base theory, equations, SDE, strength/weakness, etc), the function prototype and arguments (manual style) and the usage examples
  * The best examples are from numpy documentation: [example](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.1/reference/routines.polynomials.hermite.html)
* Validation/Test (.ipynb): one Jupyter notebook file briefly test the code/model.
  * Be a bit creative here
  * BSM/Normal model: make sure to include the analytic-vs-numerical risk test.
  * SV (SABR/Heston): make sure that the price converge to BSM/Normal if alpha(vov parameter) goes to 0
  * Spread/Basket: make sure that the price is same as single asset BSM if the weigit is 1 for only one asset and zero otherwise.
  
Other guidelines for the course project:
* The contribution will be individually graded. Make sure to show the contribution via github desktop commits (not online upload).
* The presentation next week doesn't have to be complete. Show your plan and understanding so far, e.g. function prototypes & arguments, etc and the tests to put on.

## Homeworks:
### __Set 4__ ([Starter Code](https://github.com/PHBS-2017-ASP-Classroom/SABRModel_Base))[Due by 10/23 Mon 11 PM, By group]:

SABR model option pricing:
* Volatility smile calibration with 3 option prices (or volatilities) using provided Hagan's formula
* Monte-Carlo and Conditional MC methods

### __Set 3__ ([Starter Code](https://github.com/PHBS-2017-ASP-Classroom/SpreadBasketOptions_Base))[Due by 10/10 Tues 11 PM, By group]:

Pricing basket/spread options with Monte-Carlo with control variate.

### __Set 2__ ([Starter Code](https://github.com/PHBS-2017-ASP-Classroom/BSMmodel_Base))[Due by 9/30 Sat 11 PM, By group]:

Write code for Black-Scholes-Merton and Normal model: vanilla option (call/put) price, delta, vega, CDF (digital), and price from Monte-Carlo. Implement them using python class. I am going to provide the base code from which you can build your own.

### __Set 1__ [Due by 9.18 Mon 11 PM, Individual]: 

Assume that you keep throwing a coin (H/T probabilitly p/q=1-p) __until you get two heads in a row__? Write a python function to compute this expected number of coin throw using __Monte Carlo__ method. Get one answer by averaging N simulations, and obtain M answers. Get the mean and standard deviation increasing N with fixed M (e.g. say N=100,200,400,800 and M=1000). Run the same experiment for p = 0.5, 0.25, 0.05. __Please comment on your codes so that I can understand what your code does.__

You can find the true answer for p=q=0.5 in the [HW answer](https://github.com/PHBS/2016.M3.StoFin/blob/master/files/StoFin_HW_Solution.pdf) of Stochastic finance course. You can easily generalize for general p/q.

## Course overview: 
Applied Stochastic Processes (ASP) is intended for the students who are
seeking advanced knowledge in stochastic calculus and are eventually interested in the jobs in
financial engineering. As the name indicates, the course will emphasis on applications such as
numerical calculation and programming. On completion of this course, the students will learn
how financial observations (e.g. stock prices and FX rate) are modelled with stochastic
processes and how they can be computed using analytics or computer simulations.

## Prerequisites: 
Undergraduate-level knowledge in probability, statistics, linear algebra and
programming skill (R recommended) are highly recommended. [Stochastic Finance](https://github.com/PHBS/2016.M3.StoFin) (FIN 519),
a year 1 required course for quantitative finance program, is also highly recommended as it
provides theoretical background. However these are not mandatory prerequisites. The
students without these recommended prerequisites are still encouraged to take this course if
interested, but are expected to take extra efforts.
