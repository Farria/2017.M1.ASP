## Course overview: 
Applied Stochastic Processes (ASP) is intended for the students who are
seeking advanced knowledge in stochastic calculus and are eventually interested in the jobs in
financial engineering. As the name indicates, the course will emphasis on applications such as
numerical calculation and programming. On completion of this course, the students will learn
how financial observations (e.g. stock prices and FX rate) are modelled with stochastic
processes and how they can be computed using analytics or computer simulations.

## Prerequisites: 
Undergraduate-level knowledge in probability, statistics, linear algebra and
programming skill (R recommended) are highly recommended. [Stochastic Finance](https://github.com/PHBS/2016.M3.StoFin) (FIN 519),
a year 1 required course for quantitative finance program, is also highly recommended as it
provides theoretical background. However these are not mandatory prerequisites. The
students without these recommended prerequisites are still encouraged to take this course if
interested, but are expected to take extra efforts.

##  Textbooks and Reading Materials
* Monte Carlo Methods in Finance by Peter Jaeckel
* Option Valuation Under Stochastic Volatility by Alan Lewis
* [Stochastic Calculus and Financial Applications](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~steele/StochasticCalculus.html) by J. Michael Steele
([Stochastic finance course notes](https://github.com/PHBS/2016.M3.StoFin/blob/master/files/Notes%20Steele.pdf))

## HW/Final project
During the course, students will be asked to 4~5 homeworks in mini-project styles individually or in group:

* Black-Scholes-Merton (lognormal) vs Bachelier (normal) option pricing model
* Spread/Basket (multi-asset) option pricing
* Stochastic volatility model
* Pricing equity-linked-notes (knock-out)

One of the HWs can be chosen as __a final project topic__ and students will do an in-depth research on the topic. Majority of the HW/project will be coding in Python/Jupiter notebook. (Submission of HW/project is uploading the codes to github.)

## Assessment/Grading Details
Attendance 20%, Mid-term Exam 25%, Assignments 25%, Course Project 30%
(Mid-term exam will be taken on Oct 23 in the 7th week. There will be no final exam.)
